Task 2:
One for loop and one nested for loop, the notation is O(n+n^2)
Executation time = 1574.00 micro-seconds

Task 3:
Two for loops and a sorted function, the notation is O(3n)
Executation time = 2504.00 micro-seconds

Task 4:
Six for loops and a sorted() function, the notation is O(5n)
Executation time = 460.84 mili-seconds
