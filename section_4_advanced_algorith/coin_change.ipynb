    "# Coin Change\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the fewest coins needed to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example:\n",
    "* Input: `coins = [1, 2, 3]`, `amount = 6`\n",
    "* Output: `2`\n",
    "* Explanation: The output is `2` because we can use `2` coins with value `3`. That is, `6 = 3 + 3`. We could also use `3` coins with value `2` (that is, `6 = 2 + 2 + 2`), but this would use more coinsâ€”and the problem specifies we should use the smallest number of coins possible.\n",
